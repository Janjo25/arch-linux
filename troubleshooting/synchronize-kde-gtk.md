# Synchronizing KDE and GTK Settings

1. **Install the Necessary Packages:**
   If the cursor changes when hovering over a GTK application window, you may need to synchronize the settings of KDE
   and GTK. This can be done by installing the following packages:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S kde-gtk-config gtk3
   ```

2. **Reboot for Changes to Take Effect:**
   After installing the packages, reboot your system to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
